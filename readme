What is it? 
This is some C# .NET 2.0 code to allow using the PS3 uDraw tablet on a Windows PC. 
When you run it, it places an icon in the notification (tray) area to let you know it's running 
and to configure options (few as there are at the moment). Right-click it and choose "Preferences" 
(or just press Triangle on the tablet) to bring up the options (which are saved to an INI file in 
the same directory as the application). Right-click it and choose "Exit" to quit.

How do I use it? Just run it. It will display an error if it can't find the uDraw PS3 USB dongle.

What are the controls? Use the nib/stylus on the drawing area to move the mouse cursor 
on the current monitor, You can edit each buttons operation in the preferences dialog.
